Since we include GoogleTest as a submodule, you will need to clone this repository using the ``--recursive`` directory so that the submodule will be downloaded. (If you forgot, use ``git submodule update --init --recursive``.)

git clone --recursive https://github.com/UppaJung/read-keysqr.git
cd read-keysqr
cmake .
make
ctest
```
